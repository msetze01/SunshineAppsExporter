# SunshineAppsExporter
SunshineAppsExporter is an extension for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) which allows you to export your Playnite library 
as a list of apps for [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine), enabling you to keep your gaming library in sync 
with your gamestream server.

## Features
* Export your Playnite library to a Sunshine-compatible `apps.json` file
* Automatically detect and use library plugin integrations like Steam
* Convert game cover images to Sunshine-friendly PNGs
* Restart Sunshine (if installed as a service)

This is a work-in-progress, so things like hardcoded paths and data-corrupting bugs may be present.
